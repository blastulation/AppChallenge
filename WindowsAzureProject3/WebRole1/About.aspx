    We created the Application Challenge to solve two main deficiencies we had experienced as Computer Science students at Oregon State. One being a lack of opportunities to complete creative, exciting and resume-worthy projects. The other was the lack of mentorship from experienced industry leaders. The Application Challenge will help Oregon State students obtain promising jobs and, through their mentorship experiences, display a wide range of skills that will allow them to advance quickly to leadership or senior positions.

This experience for a student can benefit them and change their life in a number of ways. The student may find a passion they had never explored before participating. By competing, the student will have another impressive project to add to their resume. Interviewers love to see that potential employees enjoy doing work for their field outside of their job. There are also a great many beneficial skills to be gained through participating, such as networking, teamwork, project management, innovation, public speaking, and more...

Along with helping students gain valuable experience, this project gives companies an opportunity to get involved and see what potential future employees exist at OSU. Students will be able to show off their technical skills and creativity, as well as get some real world experience before they graduate. The outcome of the OSU App Challenge can only benefit OSU by providing a way for students to improve themselves and also get OSU more attention from software companies that may want to connect with the university.
